# External data sources

Findings from the Phase 0 spikes, checked on 2026-11-12. None of the store sources is an
official API, so each can change without notice.

## Store offers

| Store | Source | What it gives | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AH | App API on `api.ah.nl` | Product, bonus mechanism ("2 voor 2.49"), price, price before bonus, bonus dates, category | Works anonymously |
| Jumbo | Offers page `www.jumbo.com/aanbiedingen/nu` | Promotion title, subtitle, tag text ("voor 9,99", "2e gratis"), start and end date | Promotion level, no original price |
| Lidl | Offers page `www.lidl.nl/c/aanbiedingen/…` | Product, price, pack size, in-store dates, category | Old price only on some items |

### AH
1. `POST /mobile-auth/v1/auth/token/anonymous` with body `{"clientId":"appie"}` returns an
   access token valid for about a week.
2. `GET /mobile-services/product/search/v2?query=&filters=bonus%3Dtrue&size=…&page=…` with
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `x-application: AHWEBSHOP` and an `Appie/…` user agent.
3. Relevant product fields: `title`, `salesUnitSize`, `isBonus`, `bonusMechanism`,
   `currentPrice`, `priceBeforeBonus`, `bonusStartDate`, `bonusEndDate`, `mainCategory`, `subCategory`.

The unfiltered result is capped at 10,000 products, so fetch per search term or category.
"Volume voordeel" entries (3–5% off multi-packs) are flagged as bonus and should be filtered out.

### Jumbo
The old `mobileapi.jumbo.com` endpoints return 404. The offers page embeds its data in
`<script id="__NUXT_DATA__">`: a flat JSON array in which objects refer to other entries by
index. Promotion objects have `title`, `subtitle`, `tags[].text`, `start.iso`, `end.iso`, `url`.
A GraphQL endpoint (`www.jumbo.com/api/graphql`) answers too, but its queries are not explored yet.

### Lidl
Each product tile on the offers page carries a `data-grid-data` attribute holding HTML-escaped
JSON: `fullTitle`, `price.price`, `price.oldPrice`, `price.packaging.text`, `storeStartDate`,
`storeEndDate` (Unix seconds), `category`, `keyfacts.wonCategoryPrimary`. The page holds only
the first batch of tiles (47 when checked); paging through the rest is not explored yet.
